#The yoda-project.
In lack of a final name for this language I call this the yoda-project.
If you have a proposition for a name, please let me know.

The language I am designing is a mixture of python and c#.
The compiler is written in c++ and uses llvm for the low level code generation.

The goal of this project, is the get a better understanding on the internals of a compiler without making this a life's work.

Initialy I was building this on a linux system, but these days I find myself programming more on mac, so currently I am not realy looking to support many platforms. I am sure this won't compile on a windows machine, it might compile on a linux, but nothing is guaranteed.
