The first example is that of a simple double-precision reverse polish notation
calculator (a calculator using postfix operators). This example provides a
good starting point, since operator precedence is not an issue. The second
example will illustrate how operator precedence is handled.

All sources for this calculator are found in the lurl(examples/rpn/)
directory.
