B() takes as input a context-free grammar specification and produces a
bf(C++) class offering various predefined members, among which the member
tt(parse()), that recognizes correct instances of the grammar.

In this chapter the organization and specification of such a grammar file is
discussed in detail.

Having read this chapter you should be able to define a grammar for which
B() can generate a class, including a member that will recognize
correctly formulated (in terms of your grammar) input, using all the features
and facilities offered by b() to specify a grammar. In principle this
grammar will be in the class of bf(LALR(1)) grammars (see, e.g., em(Aho, Sethi
& Ullman), 2003 (Addison-Wesley)).
