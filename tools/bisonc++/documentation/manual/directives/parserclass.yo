Syntax: bf(%class-name) tt(parser-class-name) nl() 
    By default, b() will generate a parser-class by the name of
tt(Parser). The default can be changed using this directive which defines the
name of the bf(C++) class that will be generated. It may be defined only once
and tt(parser-class-name) must be a bf(C++) identifier.

    If you're familiar with the Bison++ program, please note:
    itemization(
    it() This directive replaces the bf(%name) directive previously used by
Bison++. 
    it() Contrary to Bison++'s bf(%name) directive, bf(%class-name) may
appear anywhere in the directive section of the grammar specification file.
    )

It is an error if this directive is used and an already existing parser-class
header file does not define tt(class `className') and/or if an already
existing implementation header file does not define members of the class
tt(`className').
