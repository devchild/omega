Syntax:     bf(%error-verbose) nl()    
    The parser's state stack is dumped to the standard error stream when an
error is detected by the tt(parse()) member function. Following a call of the
tt(error()) function, the stack is dumped from the top of the stack (highest
offset) down to its bottom (offset 0). Each stack element is prefixed by the
stack element's index.
