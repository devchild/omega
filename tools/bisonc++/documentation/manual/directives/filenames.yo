Syntax:     bf(%filenames) tt(filename) nl()
           tt(Filename) is a generic filename that is used for all header
            files generated by bic().  Options defining specific filenames are
            also available (which then, in turn, overrule the name specified
            by this option).  This directive is overruled by the
            bf(--filenames) (bf(-f)) command-line option.
