The rules section of the flc() input file contains rules of the
form:

verb(pattern    action)

em(Action) is optional, and is separated from em(pattern) by spaces and/or
tabs. It consists of a single-line bf(C++)-statement, or it consists of a
compound statement that may span several lines.

Alternatively, an action may consist of a vertical bar (`|').  A vertical bar
indicates that em(pattern) uses the same action as the next rule.
