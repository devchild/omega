To Install flexc++ by hand instead of using the binary distribution perform
the following steps:

    0. Flexc++ and its construction depends, in addition to the normally
        standard available system software on specific software and versions 
        documented in the file `build-depends'.

       (If you compile the bobcat library yourself, note that flexc++ does not
        use the SSL, Milter and Xpointer classes; they may --as far as flexc++
        is concerned-- be left out of the library)

    1. It is expected you use icmake for the package construction. For this a
        top-level script (build) and support scripts in the ./icmake/
        directory are available. Icmake is available on a great many
        architectures. See also the file INSTALL.im for additional details.

    1. Inspect the values of the variables in the file INSTALL.im Modify these
       when necessary to suit your own local situation. In particular, check
       the skeletons (SKEL) and program (BINARY) specifications.

    4. Run 
            ./build program [strip]
        to compile flexc++. The argument `strip' is optional and will strip
        symbolic information from the final executable.

    5. To install the program, run (probably as root):
            ./build install program       
        
        And to install the skeleton files, run:
            ./build install skel

        If you also installed Yodl you can also do:
            ./build man
        followed by
            ./build install man
        to install flexc++'s man-page, and
            ./build manual
        followed by
            ./build install manual
        to install flexc++'s manual.

        Additionally, 
            ./build install std
        installs some additional documentation

        Just run ./build to see the actual locations that will be used.
        
    Following the installation nothing below ./tmp is required
    for the proper functioning of flexc++, so consider removing it.
